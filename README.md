# Information system "Galate"
"Galate" is an information system whose task is to simplify the registration of customers for the nearest flight for airport employees.
There are two user roles in the system:
1) An employee who can create/delete clients;
2) An admin who can do everything the same as an employee, as well as create and delete tours.

During the development, a stack of technologies was used:
WPF (MVVM), MySQL DBMS

Frontend was not executed by me.
The backend was done only by me.
